## 🔍 5. Worksheet-by-Worksheet Analysis

### 01. Data_Master – Data Management

This worksheet contains all 200 original order records along with three additional calculated columns.

**Operations Performed:**

- Organized the original dataset.
- Added Order_Month using date functions.
- Calculated Monthly_Total_Sales.
- Calculated Monthly_Sales_Growth_%.
- Converted the dataset into an Excel Table named `SalesData`.

**Excel Features Used:**

- DATE()
- YEAR()
- MONTH()
- EDATE()
- SUMIFS()
- IF()
- IFERROR()

**Custom Number Format:**

```excel
[Color10]"▲ "0.0%;[Red]"▼ "0.0%;[Black]"▬ "0.0%
```

This format displays upward, downward, and neutral monthly growth indicators.

### 02. Top_Customers – Customer Profitability Analysis

This worksheet analyzes customer performance by grouping records using Customer_ID and Customer_Name.

**Analysis Performed:**

- Total Sales by Customer
- Total Profit by Customer
- Number of Orders
- Total Quantity
- Identification of Top 10 Customers

**Excel Features Used:**

- SUMIF()
- SUMIFS()
- INDEX()
- MATCH()
- MAX()
- Conditional Formatting

**INDEX + MATCH Formula Examples:**

```excel
=INDEX(B5:B175,MATCH(MAX(C5:C175),C5:C175,0))
```

```excel
=INDEX(A5:A175,MATCH(MAX(C5:C175),C5:C175,0))
```

These formulas retrieve the customer name and customer ID associated with the highest aggregated sales value.

**Conditional Formatting:**

The Top 10 Items rule highlights customers with the highest total sales using green formatting.

### 03. What_If_Analysis – Discount Scenario Analysis

This worksheet evaluates how different discount percentages may affect estimated profit.

**Discount Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Discount Rate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 01 | 0% |
| 02 | 5% |
| 03 | 10% |
| 04 | 15% |
| 05 | 20% |
| 06 | 25% |
| 07 | 30% |

**Analysis Includes:**

- Current Total Profit
- Projected Profit
- Profit Difference
- Discount Comparison

**Excel Features:**

- What-If Analysis
- Data Table
- Goal Seek
- Scenario Calculations

**Business Purpose:**

To understand how changes in discount percentages can influence estimated business profitability.

**Model Assumption:** The projected profit calculation adjusts reported profit according to the difference between the existing discount and the selected scenario discount, applied to Sales. It is a simplified estimation and does not account for demand, cost, or product-mix changes.

### 04. Statistical_Analysis – Statistical & Regression Analysis

This worksheet performs statistical analysis on four numerical variables:

- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

**Descriptive Statistics:**

| Statistical Measure | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Mean | Calculates average value |
| Standard Error | Measures estimated sampling precision |
| Median | Identifies the middle value |
| Mode | Identifies the most frequent value |
| Standard Deviation | Measures data variation |
| Sample Variance | Measures data dispersion |
| Kurtosis | Describes distribution shape |
| Skewness | Measures distribution asymmetry |
| Range | Difference between maximum and minimum |
| Minimum | Lowest value |
| Maximum | Highest value |
| Sum | Total of values |
| Count | Number of observations |

#### Linear Regression Analysis

**Analysis:** Relationship between Sales and Profit.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| Independent Variable (X) | Sales |
| Dependent Variable (Y) | Profit |

**Regression Equation:**

```text
Estimated Profit = Intercept + (Sales Coefficient × Sales)
```

**Key Results:**

| Regression Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| R Square | Approximately 0.5982 |
| Sales Coefficient | Approximately 0.3509 |

**Interpretation:**

The R Square value of approximately 0.5982 indicates that Sales explains around 59.8% of the observed variation in Profit in this linear regression model.

The Sales coefficient represents the estimated relationship between Sales and Profit in the dataset. This relationship does not establish causation.

**Excel Feature Used:**

Data → Data Analysis → Regression

Data → Data Analysis → Descriptive Statistics

### 05. Interactive_Dashboard – Business Performance Dashboard

The Interactive_Dashboard worksheet presents the important results of the complete analysis in one place.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

| KPI | Description |
|---|---|

- Region vs Product Category Profit

**Dashboard Charts:**

| Chart | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Bar/Column Chart | Regional Sales and Profit Comparison |
